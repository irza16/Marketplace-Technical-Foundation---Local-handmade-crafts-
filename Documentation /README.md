# Local Handmade Crafts Marketplace

Welcome to the **Local Handmade Crafts Marketplace** repository! This project is part of a hackathon where the hackathon goal is to build an e-commerce platform (General, Q-Commerce, Rental , Niche, or others). I have chosen to create a niche e-commerce marketplace supporting local artisans by providing a platform for their handmade creations. This repository contains the technical foundation developed during Day 2 of the hackathon.
